Character creation mostly follows [standard D&D 5E rules](https://5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,0,step-by-step%20characters) with the following changes.

All character sheets must be made on Roll20, in the main game, and we recommend using the Charactermancer. You are welcome to also have your character sheet elsewhere, such as DNDBeyond, but only the Roll20 character sheet will be used.

Before starting a mission, you will need to [copy your character sheet](https://app.roll20.net/vault/characters) from the main game into the DMs game

### Stats
You can roll for your stats, use the standard array, or point buy. If you roll for your stats, you may choose to use your rolled stats, or use the standard array or point buy, or you may choose to reroll **ONCE**, however, if you reroll, you must choose either the first or second roll, you cannot do standard array or point buy. Please note that a DM must be present for your rolls.

### Allowed Sources
All published sources are allowed. If there are multiple published versions of the same race/class/feat/item/spell/etc, you should use the newest version. Please get approval from a DM before using any UA content. If the Unearthed Arcana has been replaced by a newer UA or has been officially published, you must use the newer version. Homebrew content must be approved by the [[Council of DMs]], and if approved, will be made available to all players.

Some races/classes/subclasses

### Races
All published races are allowed, with the following exceptions:
- Tortle (replaced with [[Skyy Tortle]])
- Warforged (replaced with [[Forged of Steam and Steel\|Steamborn and Steelborn]])

Your choice of race affects [[Homeworlds of the Races\|where your character is from]]

### Subraces
All published subraces are allowed.

The following setting-specific subraces have been reflavored to fit better:
- None yet

### Classes
All published classes are allowed.

NOTE: if your starting class has the Spellcasting feature, you cannot choose [[Emerraine]] as your homeworld.

#### Subclasses
All published subclasses are allowed.

#### Fighting Styles
All published fighting styles are allowed.

### Backgrounds
All published backgrounds are allowed.

The following setting-specific backgrounds have been reflavored to fit better:
- None yet

### Backstories
Backstories are optional.

If you do choose to write one, your character will be rewarded 1-50 experience points based on the content.

**Example 1**: If you write "I hail from Khudealine," it will gain your character approximately 1 xp.

**Example 2**: If you write something more in depth "I come from the streets of Khudealine where my father left me to fend for myself, and have lived off the streets for seven years feasting on rats most days and I finally decided to change my destiny and leave," it will gain your character approximately 20-25xp.
  
**Example 3**: If you keep it rather simple and meta-y such as "My father left me a longsword +2 and a full plate +3." your character will **not** be accepted.

### Feats
All published feats are allowed.

The following setting-specific feats have been reflavored to fit better:
- None yet

### Starting Level
Everyone starts at level 1.

### Additional Characters
Every player start with 1 character slot.

You gain an additional character slot when your first character reaches level 5, and again when reaching levels 10, 15 & 20.

If you become a DM, you gain 1 slot.

You are not allowed to play more than 1 character at a time.

### Retiring a Character

Sometimes when you create a character, that character may become unfun for you play. So, with that in mind, we will offer character retirement. Once retired, the character cannot be played again, but may remain in the world as an NPC. There are a few rules when it comes to character retirement. To keep players from just retiring bad rolls, if you retire a character before level 4, you must take the retired character stat rolls on your new character. The same follows for if your character dies prior to level 4.

If you retire a character before level 5 (1-4) your new character must start at half your retired character's level (rounded down). If you retire at level 5 or higher, you start with half experience points.
