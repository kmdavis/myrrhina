The West Marches campaign style is a persistent universe shared by a large number of players and multiple DMs, without a regular schedule, nor a regular group, and no regular plot. Between missions, players stay in town, plan their next expedition, engage in downtime activities, go shopping, etc. Planning for that next expedition is done by the players, both in terms of scheduling, and the theme, and must be requested at least a week in advance so that a DM has time to prepare. When it is time to go, the characters who signed up leave town, travel, do whatever they came to do, and then return back to town.
