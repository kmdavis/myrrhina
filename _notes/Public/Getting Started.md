### The Setting
_A courier hand delivers you a rolled up parchment. Upon opening it, you read the following:_

> Welcome, Adventurer!
> 
> 
> The **High Council**, not wishing a repeat of the **Mortuus Rex** debacle, has ordained the creation of a new **Adventurer’s Guild**, to be tasked with the peaceful exploration of the new colony world of **Myrrhina**.
> 
> 
> Congratulations! You have been chosen as one of the first adventurers to join this endeavor!
> 
> 
> Please report to the _XS Tyberium_ at Pier 87 in the **Østre Havn District** of the **High City**, for transportation down to **Sulveig**!

You are hereby invited to join us as we explore the Mysteries of Myrrhina, a West Marches Experiment for Shopifolk!

In this game, you will be a member of an Adventurer's Guild based in Sulveig, a newly established colony. At the moment, Sulveig is... well... it's basically a huge construction site. Before long, it will be a large city, but at the moment, the wide, elegant tree lined avenues are dirt roads; the imposing stone wall is just a row of hastily sharpened stakes in the ground; the city gates, the bridge foundations, and the towering portals to the High City are naught but scaffolding and piles of stone blocks. The only inhabitations are a tent city in the middle.

The City of Sulveig is built on the shores of the Sulveig River where the Marlseade River joins it and then flows to the sea. Beyond the city are forests and meadows, while far to the northwest lie an imposing mountain range.
