**Ability Scores:** Choose one of: (a) Choose any +2; choose any other +1 (b) Choose any +1; choose any other +1; choose any other +1

**Claws.** You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

**Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.

**Natural Armor.** Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

**Nature's Intuition.** Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.

**Shell Defense.** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.

**Flight**: You have an innate magical ability to fly, albeit very slowly and cumbersomely. As an action, you can takeoff, and your flying speed is 10ft (and cannot be increased) and requires concentration. As an action, you can land safely, as long as you are touching the ground. If you are knocked prone, unconscious, or otherwise loses concentration, you will fall down (and take falling damage if applicable).

**Perpetual Growth**: You never stop growing, and do not die of old age. As a Skyy Tortle grows, your speed decreases, until eventually, your metabolism almost stops and your mind and body slow to a crawl.
• A young Skyy Tortle (under 15 years) is _Small_ and has a base walking speed of 35ft.
• A young adult Skyy Tortle (15 - 35 years) is _Medium_ and has a base walking speed of 30ft.
• A mature adult Skyy Tortle (35 - 65 years) is _Large_ and has a base walking speed of 25ft. 
• An elderly Skyy Tortle (65 - 100 years) is _Huge_ and has a base walking speed of 20ft.
• An ancient Skyy Tortle (100+ years) is _Gargantuan_ and has a base walking speed of 10ft. An ancient Skyy Tortle is effectively asleep and only moves via flight.

**Villages in the Sky**: Skyy Tortles build villages atop the shells of their ancient ancestors. Starting when they are about 100 years old, an ancient Skyy Tortle is big enough to support 2 or 3 small huts, but every century, they grow enough to support 3 or 4 more huts. The oldest and largest Skyy Tortle villages have dozens of huts.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.

NOTE: Mechanically, the Skyy Tortle race is the normal Tortle race with the *Flight*, *Perpetual Growth*, & *Villages in the Sky* features added.
