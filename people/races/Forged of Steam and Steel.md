-   You are immune to disease.
-   You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Sentry's Rest**. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

**Integrated Protection**. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:

-   You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
-   You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
-   While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will.

**Specialized Design**. You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.

### Steamborn

The Steamborn were invented by the Artificers of Langsevain centuries ago, prior to the arrival of Xuartlek.

**Age**. A typical steamborn is between two and three hundred years old. The maximum steamborn lifespan remains a mystery; so far, steamborn have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects.

**Integrated Tool**. Choose one tool you’re proficient with. This tool is integrated into your body, and you double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks you make with it. You must have your hands free to use this integrated tool.

During a long rest, can you change the integrated tool. Choose a tool proficiency other than the one currently integrated. You must have the tool associated with this proficiency in your inventory. During the long rest, you will swap the two tools between your inventory and your body.

### Steelborn

The Steelborn were invented by the Artificers of Xuartlek a few decades ago. Unlike the Steamborn which are powered by steam, the Steelborn utilize powerful magic.

**Age**. A typical steelborn is between two and thirty years old. The maximum steelborn lifespan remains a mystery; so far, steelborn have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects.

**Iron Fists**. When you hit with an unarmed strike, you can deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the normal damage for an unarmed strike.

**Powerful Build**. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

NOTE: This is a modified Warforged race with 2 subraces, representing convergent design; the features of these subraces are those of the *Envoy* and *Juggernaut* subraces of the original Warforged found in UA:Races of Eberron.
