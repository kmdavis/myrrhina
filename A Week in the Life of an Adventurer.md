So... what can you expect to be doing each week during a West Marches campaign.

Let's break it down.

First off, let's talk about the things that happen at the exact same time every week.

1. Mondays are Pay Day. Your characters get paid on the first day of each month, and since a month in game is a week in real life, that's Monday. At any point on Monday (or later, if you're away) you should add your character(s) salary to their character sheet(s). “How much do I get paid?” you ask? Consult this table to find out:
| Character Level | Tier | Payroll |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| 1 | 1 | 6gp |
| 2 | 1 | 6gp |
| 3 | 1 | 6gp |
| 4 | 1 | 6gp |
| 5 | 2 | 12gp |
| 6 | 2 | 12gp |
| 7 | 2 | 12gp |
| 8 | 2 | 12gp |
| 9 | 3 | 30gp |
| 10 | 3 | 30gp |
| 11 | 3 | 30gp |
| 12 | 3 | 30gp |
| 13 | 4 | 60gp |
| 14 | 4 | 60gp |
| 15 | 4 | 60gp |
| 16 | 4 | 60gp |
| 17 | 5 | 120gp |
| 18 | 5 | 120gp |
| 19 | 5 | 120gp |
| 20 | 5 | 120gp |
2. Wednesdays are Downtime Day. Your characters probably don't spend all their time out on missions, so, between missions, they can engage in downtime activities, like making things, gambling, training, or even go get a second job. On each Wednesday, you can post what (if anything) your character(s) will be doing for the next week during any downtime. Each downtime activity involves at least 1 roll of the dice, and these rolls will be resolved (in the presence of, and with the guidance of, a DM) the following Wednesday.
3. Friday, at EOD, all shops will restock their inventory.

Okay, now that we have those regularly scheduled things out of the way, let's talk about the important stuff: *Expeditions!*

Throughout the week, check the job board (on Discord) for new Expeditions that are looking for players. Each posted job will have an assigned DM, a timeslot, a number (and level range) of players, and a summary of the job. Here's an example:

> **Through the Pass of Lechtenbruh**
> A recent expedition revealed a potential pass through the Great Western Mountains, near Mt. Lechtenbruh. We need a team to go scout the pass, clear it of any dangers, and see what is on the other side.
> **Time**: Wednesday, June 22nd at 2pm
> **Party Size**: 5
> **Levels**: 3-5

Players are encouraged to submit their own requests for expeditions.
