Character creation mostly follows standard D&D 5E rules (TODO: insert link, or just copy/paste here) with the following changes.

All character sheets must be made on Roll20, in the main game, and we recommend using the Charactermancer. You are welcome to also have your character sheet elsewhere, such as DNDBeyond, but only the Roll20 character sheet will be used.

Before starting a mission, you will need to copy your character sheet from the main game into the DMs game (TODO: more on this later)

### Stats
You can roll for your stats, use the standard array, or point buy. If you roll for your stats, you may choose to use your rolled stats, or use the standard array or point buy, or you may choose to reroll **ONCE**, however, if you reroll, you must choose either the first or second roll, you cannot do standard array or point buy. Please note that a DM must be present for your rolls.

### Allowed Sources
All published sources are allowed. Please get approval from a DM before using any UA content. Homebrew content must be approved by the Council of DMs, and if approved, will be made available to all players.

### Races
All races are allowed, with the following exceptions:
- Tortle (replaced with Skyy Tortle)

Your choice of race affects [where your character is from](racial-homeworlds).
