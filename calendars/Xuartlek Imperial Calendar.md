The Xuartlek Imperial Calendar is the official calendar of The High City & The Low City, and was developed on the world of [Tortleheim], which has since been lost to history. As such, the seasons are not in sync with any particular world any longer.

This calendar has 13 months, each of which has 28 days, divided into four 7 day weeks, for a total of 364 days. The original system of leap days was dispensed with once Xuartlek left [Tortleheim].

An online version of the calendar can be viewed on [fantasy-calendar.com](https://app.fantasy-calendar.com/calendars/665a0e0e2cb5a1c5205b0c8644220bd1)
